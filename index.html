<br>
<p class="pinkText">Penny &amp; Phillip were inseparable. Born as twins, although not identical ones, people still mixed them up all of the time. They were so very connected, as they still remain as spirits. 
When Penny &amp; Phillip were 8 years old, they were at sea with their parents. 
The weather turned terrible, and their boat sank.</p>
<br>
<p class="pinkText">Penny &amp; Phillip physically passed away, hands intertwined. Through and through, to the very end, they were always there for each other. </p>
<br>
<p class="pinkText">They remain so as kindhearted spirits within their matching musical clown vessels. </p>
<br>
<p class="pinkText">Penny &amp; Phillip's doll vessels are about 18 inches tall each, taller if you count their black little matching top hats.
They both have wind up mechanisms in their backs. If you wind them up, they'll both play you the same song.
My husband and I often hear them playing their songs in sync, when they haven't been touched at all.
And just to clarify, Penny is the one with the lighter stripes. Phillip has the darker stripes and his hair isn't in his face as much.
Penny has a rip on the front of her trousers.</p>
<br>
<p class="pinkText">Please be prepared for paranormal activity if you decide to become the twins' new keeper. As innocent child spirits of white light, full of love, they spread only positivity.. and they spread it doubly.
If you seek positivity &amp; happiness, along with paranormal activity, then these dear twins are perfect for you!
They have a way of making you feel less lonely, and they draw other spirits in. 
Really, their energy must be experienced to be fully understood. 
Penny &amp; Phillip are a duo unlike any other. They will bring you smiles and so much more. They're fabulous and a joy to have.
You won't regret bringing them into your home. They make everything, quite simply... better! </p>
<br>
<p class="pinkText">~Penny &amp; Phillip communicate via Ouija board, pendulum, EVP, spirit dice, and dream walking. </p>
<br>
<p class="pinkText">~They both create EMF fluctuation--I forgot to take pictures showing this. If you want to see pictures, just message me and I'lll take them and send them to you. </p>
<br>
<p class="pinkText">~Penny &amp; Phillip reveal themselves through orbing. They present 2 light purple orbs, that dance together in the night, sometimes straying to dance around my animals. They love them so.</p>
<br>
<p class="pinkText">~These sweet twins love all animals as well as people. They are especially fond of other children, and really light up if children are present at all. They get so excited, you can feel it in the air, and they love to play their music for children too. </p>
<br>
<p class="pinkText">~Penny &amp; Philip enjoy moving their vessels. I will find Penny in one corner of a room, and Phillip in the opposite corner... and then hear their distinct giggling. They certainly have a fun sense of humor. </p>
<br>
<p class="pinkText">~If you play music for these siblings, they will become more active, and often you will hear their own music going off simultaneously. </p>
<br>
<p class="pinkText">~They have shared with me that one day they came across a box that had abandoned kittens in it. They begged their mother. She finally caved. Penny goes on about the all white kitten she chose and named Girly, and Phillip adopted the orange kitten with big blue eyes he named Max. They loved their kitties so very much, and would play pretend with them and have laughs for hours on end. They have shown me visions of this.</p>
<br>
<p class="pinkText">~They will interact with electronics and are especially fond of flickering lights and draining batteries, so be prepared for that. </p>
<br>
<p class="pinkText">~We hear the sound of two sets of little footsteps running along together, and we have seen 2 blurry shadow figures from the corner of our eyes when we hear these stepping sounds. </p>
<br>
<p class="pinkText">If you find yourself feeling drawn to Penny and Phillip, it is for a reason. </p>
<br>
<p class="pinkText">Are you the one for these sweet twins?
I am only parting with them because they expressed to me that it is time to move on and make brand new friends and have exciting new adventures.</p>
<br>
<p class="pinkText">If you choose to adopt them into your life, please understand something of great importance--spirits like them do not always reveal themselves immediately. You need to give them time and space. Sometimes it happens right away, but it's quite rare. More often than not, a spirit needs months to feel comfortable enough to begin showing activity. It also depends on YOUR own experience with the paranormal at times. I have had clients that have experienced it right away, yes, but usually I'll hear from them a month, or even 6 months later that things are happening finally. </p>
<br>
<p class="pinkText">I cannot stress it enough... Give spirits time. Give them space. Remain open minded and you will be amazed. 
[By the way, I wrote this. I've noticed many other sellers on eBay literally copied and pasted this from me, along with other things. Just letting everyone know. :) ]</p>
<br>
<p class="pinkText">If you have any questions at all about Penny &amp; Phillip or about me for that matter, please feel free to send me a message. I'd be happy to provide more info for you.</p>

<br>
                            <p class="pinkText">Please read my Feed Backs and you will see I am the real DEAL !!</p>
<br>
                            <p class="pinkText">Hi let me introduce myself to you.  My name is Terri and I am a paranormal investigator.  I have been collecting spiritual dolls and items for over 35 years.  I travel to many different areas in the United States in search of paranormal items and activities.  People on here are always asking me how do I have so many spiritual dolls to sell here on EBay so I thought I would give you all some background on me. I also live by a very old and large Cemetery that backs up to my home !  So I have no problem attracting spirits and entities to attach themselves to my items..  Ok enough about me now lets get to the spiritual item here up for bids  ..</p>
<br>
                            <p class="pinkText">WILLY  IS NOT A TOY TO PLAY WITH !!!</p>
<br>
                            <p class="pinkText">Here is Willy  a spiritual clown vessel that is 11 inches tall  and on his unicycle bike. Willy the Clown like's to play with the lights and TV , Radio and much more. He also likes to move from spots that he was in when you last seen him at !   I got his name from a spirit box and confirmed it on my Ouija Board as  Willy, and it fits him well. 
    I got him around 25 years ago he is a very old soul but very active .  I am sure that  the spirit that has attached himself to this vessel is a very old soul that lived back in the  early 1900's this is what i keep getting from my Ouija Board.  I have seen shadow figures around him many times. We have also seen what looked like a mist around him many times.  
   We have heard the sound of voices and knocks on the walls ,and the sound of laughing lots of times. He always will be one of my most favorite small spiritual  Clown vessels.
  I have seen shadow figures and felt cold spots all around Willy, and in his room ,Willy may be small but he packs one big PUNCH !</p>
<br>
                            <p class="pinkText">I keep him in his room setting on his unicycle bike on the corner of his his bed on the headboard.  He likes to turn the TV channels and mess with the lights, Radio, door bell and open up your kitchen cabinet doors and drawers and bedroom doors and closets. Willy the clown is a fun spirit to have around the home.  If you do become the new owner of this spiritual vessel please leave your feedback and tell me all the things that he has done around you and in your home, and I will love to put it in my new ads if that is Ok with you.</p></div>

My name is Laci so feel free to call me by my name. I come from a long line of witches; my great great grandmother, my great-grandmother, my grandmother, my mother & sister, and now myself. My husband and I have a beautiful little boy named Lee. We have been together since we were teenagers and he too also practices the art of Magick. I am also in a wonderful Coven, and without these lovely ladies, I would not be the person that I am today. I have friends all over the world, and those numbers continuously grow.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="pinkText">I believe in harming none and helping all. I also believe that everyone is entitled to an opinion and their different beliefs; I respect everyone. Everyone should get a chance to experience the paranormal in one way or another, and I hope that you will entrust me as the one who can make this happen. My spirits are very dear to me, and each one has their own little story just like each one of us does. Please take your time browsing some of my collection that I am re-homing. All spirits that are listed are ACTIVE and have been tested on numerous occasions.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="pinkText">By now, many of you have come into contact with my spirit children and know that they are authentic! I take pride in being able to offer you a paranormal experience that many can only dream about. You WILL get activity with all of my spirit vessels that I re-home; there are no doubts whatsoever in my mind. Many of my spirits have made many disbelievers into believers!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="pinkText">My husband and I have been re-homing spirits and entities for many years now. It is with great honor to offer our spirits! Once our spirit children have been adopted we will be continuing our journey into the paranormal world to offer the most active and amazing spirits we come into contact with!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="pinkText">THIS IS A TANGIBLE ITEM</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="pinkText">YOU WILL GET TRUE WEALTH WITH LARISSA!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="pinkText">Today I present to you the powerful spirit of Larissa. She is a wealth-bringing spirit. Imagine yourself with the wealth you know you deserve. Visualize your future with Larissa and the fortune you SHOULD have. This is what Larissa will give you. No more monetary worries!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="pinkText">YOUR MUCH DESERVED FORTUNE WILL BE YOURS!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="pinkText">I know what you're thinking, this sounds too good to be true, right? Well, worry not. Larissa will help you visualize where you want to be in this world. The first lesson in magick is visualization. If you can see yourself in your mind as wealthy, then you can become wealthy. Anyone experienced in magick knows this. If you place your desire in your mind's eye, with Larissa's help you will get what you deserve.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="pinkText">Larissa has been in my collection for a while now. Her and I have shared many meditation sessions visualizing what we want. This is key and it is why I am mentioning it so much. Larissa will grant you the power of positive thinking. She will grant you the wealth you want. Her energy will influence you SO MUCH! You will never meet another spirit like her. She is an authentic wealth spirit. These are rare beings. You will not find any other like her.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="pinkText">She came to me from the daughter of a land owner in Texas. She said she had infused her father's wealth into the spirit through countless hours of manifestation. Truth was, Larissa was the one who gave her father his wealth. The daughter was who bound the spirit to this vessel.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="pinkText">Larissa is an active spirit. Because of her high energy, you will see many paranormal things happen in your home after you adopt her. She will whisper into your ear. Mostly she will speak of positive affirmations. She will mess with your electronics. You will hear footsteps coming from other rooms.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="pinkText">She is highly communicative. She speaks best through Ouija, dowsing, and pendulum. If you don't have a Ouija board, you can find easy to follow instructions online to make one. It is easy and inexpensive. You can also record her through EVP. Just use the recorder function on your phone and the magick will happen!</p>

You get the sense of being watched. I have had door knobs turn. I've heard footsteps and bangs. Doors have opened and closed on their own. I would not say it is an evil presence, or dark in any way. More so a curious spirit?</p>

Once she moved out of the state I came in possession of it. Asked my girls if the wanted it and that was the wrong thing to do!. They both were really creeped out by it saying it gave them a weird feeling. I put it in a bin in the garage a few years ago and pretty much forgot about it until about a week ago. I took it out and had my now teenage daughters come out to see if they "jokingly" wanted it. Being a typical Dad of course was the wrong move again. They yelled at me to throw it away or throw it in the fire pit. I told them I got rid of it but figured someone on here would love to take her into a new home.

                        <br><p class="pinkText">Thank you for looking at my auction.  I don't attempt to say I'm an expert in the paranormal.  There is so much to experience and time included in this activity.  I have been on many haunted and paranormal searches with people that I consider much more experienced then me.  Some of the experiences I have encountered have been false, while others have been such an exciting experience to be in the same space with a new spirit.  I have collected many things from these places, stones, dolls, bottles, scriptures, pictures ect. I believe that spirits can attach themselves to tangible items for all kinds of reasons. I am going to put up for auction, many of my items, because I would like to pursue investigating on a full time schedule.</p>

                        <br><p class="pinkText">She is a sad, depressed, angry spirit. What I know about her so far is that someone found her on a hiking trail in Vermont. They kept her for a few weeks and strange things started happening in there home and they  felt it was because of the doll so they sent it to a thresh shop to get rid of it.  I found her in a second hand shop a couple years ago and I was drawn to her right away.  She has told me that she was in her 20's when she died but won't tell me details about her death yet. She has said that she misses him but I don't know who him is. She also has made it clear that she is depressed, and very sad. At times she gets angry and will slam doors and scream. She also has made our power go out for about 10 minutes then it came back on. A couple times I've seen her turn her head to look at me which was a little freaky. When I'm talking with her through my spirit board I have felt her pain and sadness and anger. Maybe you can help her find some peace.</p>
                        <br><p class="pinkText">The doll itself is 20" high and has brownish red hair and beautiful green eyes. She is wearing a green dress with an ivory, lacey overlay and has a green bow in her hair. She has bloomers and porcelain boot / shoes.</p>

                        <br><p class="pinkText">She was 28 when she passed away.  When she was younger she took ballet lessons and loved to dance. She dreamed of being a ballerina. She worked hard and after school she opened her own little ballet studio and taught children. She loved kids but never married or had any children of her own. One of the fathers of one of her students started getting to friendly and would spend a lot of time at her studio. He started stocking her and tried to convince her that she loved him but when she rejected his attention he got mad and blew up and killed her.
  Charlotte is a loving, gentle spirit who still loves to dance.  She has a bright white orb and loves to dance around the house and I have heard her humming as she is dancing.  She still loves children and will watch over them with love and protection. I can feel her spirit throughout my home and it's very comforting. When I'm having a bad day, she always make me feel better.
 The doll itself is 16 " high and she has dark brown hair and brown eyes. She is wearing a ivory shirt with tutu attached and ivory  tights. She has ivory ballet slipper also. She is wearing a beading necklace and has a flower ribbon in her hair.</p>
